            <h1>Essaouira and Argan oil</h1>

            <p>Essaouira is a beautiful seaside town in Morocco steeped in history and is also a UNESCO world heritage
                site. It’s about 2 hours away from Marrakech so I made it a day trip. The main export from Essaouira are
                fishing (especially sardines) and Argan fruit products. The fishermen bring their catch to the shores
                where everyone is waiting for fresh seafood. The souks were a maze of stalls with colorful treasures,
                spices and of course argan products. The Medina was full of leather products, jewelry, pottery,
                beautiful kaftans and jalabiyas. I bought all of my argan oils, body scrubs, soaps and spices in the
                medina. A seafood lunch was also easy to eat in the medina.</p>

            <h2>Let’s talk about Argan oil</h2>
            <p>First forget everything you’ve seen that is said to contain argan oil. Lies and I mean huge ones! Ok
                fine, maybe a drop per litre is in that shampoo sis.. ? ? ? ? Essaouira to Agadir has an argan corridor
                of about 300km of argan trees. Argan trees are found only in morocco across 4 cities but the best ones
                are in Essaouira. June, July and August is Argan harvest season. Argan nuts start out harvested green in
                color, turn yellow and finally brown.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>There are 3 ways of harvesting argan fruit:</p>
                <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0;">
                    <li><strong>By hand:</strong> When ripe, yields best quality</li>
                    <li><strong>By machinery:</strong> (Companies are here now) this yields medium grade</li>
                    <li><strong>Goats in tree:</strong> Goats in trees eat the shell off the fruit and regurgitate the
                        nuts. It yields the lowest grade.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>There are 2 types of argan oils, cosmetic and edible. You need about 40kg of fruit to yield 2.5kg edible
                Argan oil and 60kg of fruit yields 5kg of cosmetic oil. So edible argan oil is more expensive than
                cosmetic. The women in the cooperative work in 2 shifts morning and evening. We were told the ladies
                rest when off shift. According to the guide they allegedly get 50% of the profits. There are so many
                products made from the argan fruit. Oils, shampoos, soaps, conditioners, lotions and much more.</p>

            <h2>Manual Extraction Process</h2>
            <p>The outer shell covering is crushed between two stones revealing the nut. The argan nut is cracked
                between 2 stones to remove the seed (looks just like shelled almond). The shell is used as a fire
                accelerant. The seeds are roasted and then crushed in a hand spinner extractor to create a paste. The
                paste is later separated by hand to reveal the oil.</p>

            <div class="video-placeholder">Watch: Argan ladies extracting oil</div>

            <p>The left-over brown paste after this process is mixed with Olive oil extraction by products to make black
                soaps. This black soap is used in hammams and I can testify your skin will be baby soft and glow when
                used. The edible argan oil is mixed with honey and almond in a paste called Amlou. It can be spread on
                breads and pastries. I bought a good amount to take home. Every part of the argan fruit is used for
                something.</p>
